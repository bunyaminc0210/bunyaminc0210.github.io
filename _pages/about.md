# Welcome to this blog. 

My name is BÃ¼nyamin, I'm 32 years old and I'm passionate about cybersecurity. Since I was young, I have always been fascinated by technologies and their potential, and that is how I discovered my passion for cybersecurity.

Over the years, I have taken several trainings in Pentesting and web hacking, and I have acquired solid skills in this field. I love discovering new techniques and methods to protect business and personal systems and data, and I am constantly looking for new opportunities to learn more.

On this page, I would like to share my background with you and give you an overview of my experience and skills. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to learn more about my work in the cybersecurity field. Thank you for your visit!
